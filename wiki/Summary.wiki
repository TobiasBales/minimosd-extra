A project to add extra functions to MinimOsd code.

This firmware defaults to PAL, but handles NTSC also, if an NTSC video is connected on boot. (It only defaults to PAL if no video connected.)
This firmware is airworthy, but some panels, like windspeed still need some testing.

*Added:*<br>
Changed unit measurement of speed from m/s to Km/h or M/h (Selectable from OSD menu)<br>
Airspeed<br>
Home alt<br>
Battery Percent<br>
Current Draw<br>
Time From Startup<br>
OSD Menu<br>
Variometer<br>
Warning messages for:<br>
- Lost GPS fix<br>
- Stall (can be set in OSD menu)<br>
- Overspeed (can be set in OSD menu)<br>
- Battery warning percent<br>
- Battery warning volt (can be set in OSD menu)<br>
Wind speed and direction (Experimental. Needs to be tested, and tuned)<br>
OSD on/off<br>

These functions can be turned on and off by the Config tool.


*About the menu:*<br>
I made a menu inside OSD. You can enter this menu only in the first 1 minute after boot, the same way as OSD off works. (Switch from one mode to another then back to the first within 2 seconds. Except RTL and CIRCLE so no accidental switching on poor reception.)


Enjoy


If you want to build your own firmware, use Arduino IDE (0022 version for me) and select under Tools / Board : *Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (5V, 16 MHz) w/ ATmega328*
