This functions can be turned on and off, and placed on different screens now, by the Config. tool.

Also RSSI, switching mode and channel and unit measurement, Stall speed warning, Overspeed warning, Battery warning volt, Battery percent warning, RSSI warning,  can be set in new Config Tool.



We built in a new way of setting video standards. Now OSD does not guessing anymore :). You can set it fixed from CT. It is in "Video Mode" menu.


If you could send me a tlog file of an average flight.... Than i would be able to test it. :)

Or could anyone flight test it, and upload the OSD video about it? 



About the menu:

I made a menu inside OSD. You can enter this menu only after boot, the same way as screen switching works.
