If you could send me a .tlog file of an average flight.... Than I would be able to test it. :)

Or could anyone flight test it, and upload the OSD video about it? 



About the menu:

I made a menu inside OSD. You can enter this menu only after boot, the same way as screen switching works.


The latest stable version is: 2.1
