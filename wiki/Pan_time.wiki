= Time =

Time panel shows the time from MinimOSD-Extra booted up. 

Normaly this is all your systems boot time also (when only one on board battery is used and or all electronics are turned on together.), but you can reset MinimOSD-Extra by pressing reset button on it. Than this panel will start counting again from zero.
