= Home Altitude =

This panel indicates your hight above your home position in meters if you set metric system for unit measurement, and feats if imperial. 

== It works this way: ==

When APM boots and gets GPS lock, it checks your hight above sea level than calibrates you barometric pressure sensor. After this it is using baro hight by default. 
From this moment, MinimOSD-Extra stores this hight, than substract it from your actual true hight sou you see your home alt.

(You can change it in APM parameters to use only GPS to measure hight, or only baro hight (this is default) or a mix of bough.)
