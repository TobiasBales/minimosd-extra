First you need to enable this function in APM (config.h).
Look for "# define RECEIVER_RSSI_PIN -1"
Than change it to "# define RECEIVER_RSSI_PIN 6"
I have changed it to 6 as i use port 6. If you use a different port, replace 6 with your port number.

If you use APM2 than look for
#define CONFIG_APM_HARDWARE APM_HARDWARE_APM2
in APM_Config.h
(than comply and upload)

You have to teach OSD to "read your receiver".

Open CT cehck the "RSSI Enable Raw" checkbox so when you power up your OSD with APM, you will see the raw values. After APM have booted up and you have your tx working (antenna pulled out), than it will show the raw value that you set in "RSSI Max Value" box. 
Than turn your tx off, so it will show the raw value that you set in "RSSI Min Value" box.
Than plug your OSD to FTDI again, and uncheck "RSSI Raw Value" checkbox, than save it to osd.
After this OSD will show RSSI normaly.
