= Altitude =

This panel indicates your hight above sea level in meters if you set metric system for unit measurement, and feats if imperial.

== It works this way: ==

When APM boots and gets GPS lock, it checks your hight above sea level than calibrates you barometric pressure sensor.
After this it is using baro hight by default.

But you can change this in APM parameters. You can use only GPS or a mix of bough also.
